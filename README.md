## Description

This is a simple and rather pointless demo app to show off the awesomeness of Kotlin on Android. All it does is take a word from the user and make a call to `http://thesaurus.altervista.org` to retrieve a list of synonyms; which it then displays to the user.

Note: Since it's just a demo, some parts of the app are really hacky, especially the JSON parsing bit. I'll improve on it as and when I can be bothered.


## Contributing

Since this is a demo app, feel free to add literally any feature you wish and open a PR! :) 
The only requirement is that it has to be written in Kotlin.
